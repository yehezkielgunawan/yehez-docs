This is my personal "second brain". I've exhausted googling the same thing every time, so I put the tools, library, or framework that I frequently use to this site. You can access the live demo at [docs.yehezgun.com](https://docs.yehezgun.com).

This project was scaffolded using [Nextra Docs Template](https://nextra.vercel.app/).

Actually, I made it for myself. But of course, I'm open to any feedback. You can email me at [yehezkiel.gunawan28@gmail.com](mailto:yehezkiel.gunawan28@gmail.com), **if you found any deprecated or just want to give some suggestion.** Thank you.
